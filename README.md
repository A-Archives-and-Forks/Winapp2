A database of extended cleaning routines for popular Windows PC based maintenance software. 

There are 2 Winapp2 files published here. One is for CCleaner use, which is modified to remove entries because they were added in CCleaner. The other one is for BleachBit, System Ninja, and Avira System Speedup, which contains all entries, even the removed ones. Please use the proper one for your cleaner to avoid any issues happening.

; 
; This file is part of a collection of winapp2ool ini files that are used to generate winapp2.ini
; and thus is not intended to be used standalone or with any cleaning software
;
; Most entries in these files are incomplete and may not function as expected if used on their own
; 
; winapp2ool uses this file to apply a BleachBit flavor to winapp2.ini
; This is done to reduce under and over-coverage
; winapp2ool applies this file using Transmute with the Transmute mode set to Replace - ByKey
; 
; Corrections are always applied in order:
; section removals -> key value removals -> key name removals -> section replacements
; -> key replacements (this file) -> additions
; 
; Any keys defined here will replace entirely keys in the entry of the same name in winapp2.ini
; Only keys of exactly the same name within sections of the exact same name will be replaced
; To replace an entire section, place the replacement data in bb_section_replacements.ini

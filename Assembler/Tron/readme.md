# Tron Flavor Transmutation Rules 

### What is this? 

This folder contains the set of Transmutation rules required by Winapp2ool to produce the [Tron flavor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoscaDotTo/Winapp2/refs/heads/master/Non-CCleaner/Tron/Winapp2.ini) of Wianpp2.ini 

### What changes are made to create the Tron flavor? 

The Tron flavor is created by adopting the changes made downstream by the Tron maintainers to their copy of Winapp2.ini. Currently, this is only the removal of the Depot Cache cleaning from `Steam`

# Winapp2.ini Base Entries 

### What is this?

This folder contains the set of base entries for winapp2.ini, delineated into 27 different files alphabetically. Each file contains all of the entries in Winapp2.ini which begin with its particular letter (numbers and symbols can be found in `#.ini`), and also do not target web browsers.

These files are assembled by Winapp2ool as part of the Winapp2.ini build process. Contributions to Winapp2.ini should be made against these files and not Winapp2.ini itself

### What about web browser entries?

Web browser entries are generated through the Browser Builder process. Contributions to browser entries should be made against the files in [this folder](https://github.com/MoscaDotTo/Winapp2/tree/master/Assembler/BrowserBuilder).

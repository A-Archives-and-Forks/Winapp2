### What is this? 
ccinidebug.exe is a tool for alphabetizing ccleaner.ini's contents, and additionally for pruning out "stale" winapp2.ini entries.

### How to use
* Place ccinidebug.exe in a folder with ccleaner.ini. 
- If you wish to prune stale winapp2.ini entries, also place winapp2.ini in this folder. 
* run ccinidebug.exe

You will be asked press Y to confirm that you want to check winapp2.ini and for alphabetization. Pressing any other key will suffice as a "no".

###### Note
You may need to run ccinidebug.exe as an administrator if you place it directly in the default CCleaner directory.
